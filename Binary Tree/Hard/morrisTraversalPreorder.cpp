SC : 1 ( normally n [stack,queue] )

In-order Morris Traversal:
ðŸŒ³ 1st case: if left is null, 
                print current node 
                and go right
ðŸŒ³ 2nd case: before going left, 
             make right most node on left subtree connected to current node ( right_most->right = cur ), 
             print the current node 
             then go left
ðŸŒ³ 3rd case: if thread is already pointed to current node, 
                then remove the thread


2nd case WHY -> 
if the right most node on left subtreee does not have thread to its root , how will it go to root so connect the thread and move left so that afterward you can directly come to the node ( no need of backtracking  ) 

WHY ARE WE CREATING THREAD WHEN WE ARE AT SOME NODE ?
because we are NOT going to COME on that node AGAIN so before moving to left go to right most node on left subtree and create the thread 

3rd case WHY --> 
if there is any thread that means we made it and we have traversed left subtree thats why there is a thread so now its time to remove the thread the thread and move to right subtree

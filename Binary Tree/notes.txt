TYPE

Full BT --> 0 or 2 Children 
Complete BT --> n-1 level Completelely filled , node in last level should be placed as left they can 
Perfect BT --> All leaf node should be on the same level
Balanced BT --> height should be at max log(n)
Degenerate / Skewed BT --> every node has single child , n nodes in n level ( like linked list ) 


Pre/In/Post order Traversal ( DFS )
    TC : n
    SC : n

Level order Traversal ( BFS ) 
    TC : n
    SC : n




Medium Problem 

height : O(n)
balance tree : 
    O(n*n) node*height 
    try to solve it in o(n) --> modify height wala method

graph can have multiple Spanning tree (ST) , but ovs 1 MST 
ST 
    n node , n-1 node , all node should be reachable from all others  
MST 
    ST with minimum combined egde's weigth


PRIMS Algo 
    finds MST

    Algo
        take the vertex out 
        mark them as visited if not ( put the edge on MST array , update the sum variable ) 
        take the adj node , put them in queue 

    Intution : Greedy 

    TC : E log E ( E is no. of edge )
    SC : E


Disjoint Set 
    wheather 2 node exist in a same component or not ( IN CONSTANT TC )
    you can find it using DFS/BFS but in O(V+E)

    options : 
        findParent() 
            finds the parent or ultimate parent in array 
            TC : 4*alpha == CONSTANT

        Union() can be done by rank or size 
            connects the 2 nodes 
            TC : 4*alpha == CONSTANT ( both )

    TC : 4*alpha == CONSTANT ( alpha is close to 1 )


Kruskal's Algo
    finds MST

    Algo    
        sort all the edges acc to weigth
        apply Disjoint Set on all the edges to connect nodes ( if the nodes in different component then add it and it will be the parts of the MST else dont add it in MST ) 



Kosaraju's Algorithm
    Strongly connected component --> only on Directed graph

    A component is called a Strongly Connected Component(SCC) only if for every possible pair of vertices (u, v) inside that component, u is reachable from v and v is reachable from u.

    Steps: 
        Sort all the nodes according to their finishing time:
        Reverse all the edges of the entire graph:
        Perform the DFS and count the no. of different DFS calls to get the no. of SCC:

    TC : 3*(V+E)

Two different connected components becomes a single component if a edge is added between a vertex from one component to a vertex of other component. But this is not the case in strongly connected components. Two strongly connected components doesnâ€™t become a single strongly connected component if there is only a unidirectional edge from one SCC to other SCC.

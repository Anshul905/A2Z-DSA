Dijkstra 
    fails when there is a negative edge or negative cycle
    if negative cycle -> infinite loop (TLE)
    does not detect negative cycle
    returns shortest distance from one node to all  node 
    TC = E*log(V)



Bellman
    works with only Directed graph 
    if undirected graph is given , make it Directed graph by adding edge to both side
    detect negative cycle
    src to all nodes distance  
    
    Algo 
        Relax all thge edges to n-1 times 
        Why n-1?
            n node -> in worst case you will take n-1 edges to reach from starting node to last node 
        How to detect negative cycle?
            on nth iteration , if the array values keep reducing that means there is a negative edge cycle 
            because we need n-1 iteration to get the shortest distance at worst 


Floyd Warshell Algo 
    multisource graph 
    used to detect negative cycle ( but if there is a negative cycle it does not make sense to find shortest path so it is not negatuve cycle )  
    if given undirected graph --> converted it to Directed graph

    returns shortest distance from all node to all  node 

    TC = V*V*V
    TC = V*E*log(V) { using Dijkstra but there must not be negative cycle}


    Algo
        calculate the diatance of every vertex to every vertex via 0 then ( 1, 2, 3 , ..., n-1 )
        ans you will get final matrix 

    How to detect negative cycle?
        if any dis[i][i] < 0 --> this means there is a negative cycle because it should not 0 and during calculation of distance via all the nodes if it gets negative value then there is a cycle
